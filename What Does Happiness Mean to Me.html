<p>I havent quite figured out yet what I would consider being happiness or at least how it relates to my life. I think that lately I've been looking for happiness in a variety of things. I've been looking for happiness in my life, through things such as my family, friends, school, job, my health, money, community, and etc. I don't think I have found what i'm looking forward to quite yet, but im learning thats ok because one can never truely be happy, at least not all the time. Thats what I think. So If I had to answer this question, what does happiness mean to me, my answer wouldn't be just one thing in particular. I guess my answer would vary between what my current mood is, my last feeling, or high moment. </p>
